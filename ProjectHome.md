This project is developing a means of controlling a stereoscopic rendering system with NITE gesture events generated by the Microsoft Kinect platform.

We have developed a software tool that links to the 'IDispatch' methods provided by the NVIDIA 3D Vision Stereo Player and connected them with gesture recognition events provided by the OpenNI and NITE API.
